  <h2><center>About me</center></h2>
  <p>I was born in Pomona, California on January 11th, 1997. I was about one or two years old when my family and I moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, which is where I have been living my whole life. My family and I lived in a small apartment for about 7 years before moving to our current house. Throughout all my childhood and even still to this day I've been a quite, shy person who likes to observe everything around me, however, that is changing as I am becoming more socially active. The first school I went to was Saint Bernard's School, but unfortunately it closed when I was in the sixth grade and so I had to go to a new one called Saint Agnes High School. I graduated from there on May 30th, 2015. After that I decided to go to college and I chose to attend Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. I will graduate from Luther College in 2019 and I plan to major in computer science.</p>
